### What is the application and how does it function?

This is a sports ranking app that allows users to rank players or teams, save and manage their rankings, and access them later through a dedicated saved rankings tab. The app connects to TheSportsDB API, allowing users to read detailed information on teams and players, including images and background. Navigation is handled with bottom tabs, making it easy to move between rankings, saved rankings, and team/player info pages.

We used the free api from thesportsdb: https://www.thesportsdb.com/

## Introduction

### Communication Management

Communication took place for the most part through Slack. Our team attempted to hold zoom meetings but it was difficult to find a time where everyone was available to meet so we just kept is simple and used Slack to text. 

### Initial Planning

- **How many stories/issues were initially considered?**  
  We initially considered 16 User stories/issues.

- **How many stories/issues were completed?**  
We were able to complete 12 issues.

## Individual Contributions: 

### What was your role / which stories did you work on?

Jose Valdez-Fernandez: I contributed by implementing the API integration and developing key features, including the search page for finding users, the teams page for filtering and viewing team information, and the rankings page for ranking players. In addition, I designed the home page to provide a clear and user-friendly starting point for the app.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Biggest challenge faced?

Jose Valdez-Fernandez: For me the biggest challenges faced where having to learn/work with new techonolgies in a rather short time period as well as having to divide work amongst a team and ensuring everything gets completed.

### Why was it a challenge?

Jose Valdez-Fernandez: This was a challenge because learning new technologies can be difficult, especially since there is no one really there to guide you all the time. Additionally, working in teams can be a bit challenging at times as you have to make sure everyone knows what they are doing and staying on top of what they are supposed to do.

## Conclusion

### How successful was the project?
We would say the project went rather well, we completed what we wanted to do and we are happy with the overall look and structure of the app. 

### What was the largest victory?

The largest victory was getting a running app that users can actually use to rank their favorites players and teams from any sport. 

### Final assessment of the project

We all felt that this project was rather challenging and stressful but in the end the experience was rewarding. We got a taste of what a software enginering project might look like for potentially our futures after school.
