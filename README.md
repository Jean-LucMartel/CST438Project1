### What is the application and how does it function?

This is a sports ranking app that allows users to create their own personal rankings lists of their favorite players or teams, save and manage their rankings, and access them later through a dedicated saved rankings tab. The app connects to TheSportsDB API, allowing users to search and read detailed information on teams and players from any sport, including images and team history. Navigation is handled with bottom tabs, making it easy to move between rankings, saved rankings, and team/player info pages.

We used the free api from thesportsdb: https://www.thesportsdb.com/

## Introduction

### Communication Management

Most of our communication took place through Slack. Although we attempted to hold Zoom meetings, it was difficult to find a time that worked for everyone, so we kept it simple and relied mainly on Slack messaging.

### Initial Planning

- **How many stories/issues were initially considered?**  
  We initially considered 16 User stories/issues.

- **How many stories/issues were completed?**  
We were able to complete 12 issues.

## Individual Contributions: 

### What was your role / which stories did you work on?

Jose Valdez-Fernandez: I contributed by implementing the API integration and developing key features, including the search page for finding users, the teams page for filtering and viewing team information, and the rankings page for ranking players. In addition, I designed the home page to provide a clear and user-friendly starting point for the app.

## Challenges & Solutions

### Biggest challenge faced?

Jose Valdez-Fernandez: A major challenge I faced was having to quickly learn and work with new technologies, which meant balancing learning the tools with actually applying them to the project. Another challenge was dividing the workload among team members and making sure everyone stayed on track so that all parts of the project were completed on time.

Andrew Arreola:

### Why was it a challenge?

Jose Valdez-Fernandez: This was a challenge because learning new technologies on my own was difficult, especially without constant guidance or prior experience to rely on. Additionally, working in a team required making sure everyone understood their responsibilities and staying organized so that all tasks were completed on time.
