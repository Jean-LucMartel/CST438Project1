## Overview:

Team Members: Jose Valdez-Fernandez, Jean-Luc Martel, Elijah Hart, Andrew Arreola

### What is the application and how does it function?

This is a sports ranking app that allows users to create their own personal rankings lists of their favorite players or teams, save and manage their rankings, and access them later through a dedicated saved rankings tab. The app connects to TheSportsDB API, allowing users to search and read detailed information on teams and players from any sport, including images and team history. Navigation is handled with bottom tabs, making it easy to move between rankings, saved rankings, and team/player info pages.

We used the free api from thesportsdb: https://www.thesportsdb.com/

## Introduction

### Communication Management

Most of our communication took place through Slack. Although we attempted to hold Zoom meetings, it was difficult to find a time that worked for everyone, so we kept it simple and relied mainly on Slack messaging.

### Initial Planning

- **How many stories/issues were initially considered?**  
  We initially considered 16 User stories/issues.

- **How many stories/issues were completed?**  
We were able to complete 12 issues.

## Individual Contributions: 

### What was your role / which stories did you work on?

Jose Valdez-Fernandez: I contributed by implementing the API integration and developing key features, including the search page for finding users, the teams page for filtering and viewing team information, and the rankings page for ranking players. In addition, I designed the home page to provide a clear and user-friendly starting point for the app.

Jean-Luc Martel:

Elijah Hart: I contributed by creating the database for the app as well as helping to add some user functionality, including the top 10 ranking page, and the user profile tab. 

Andrew Arreola: I contributed by making the layouts for the home page as well as the favorites page. I also made favorites functional by letting users click add to favorites when searching up a player in the search page.


## Challenges & Solutions

### Biggest challenge faced?

Jose Valdez-Fernandez: A major challenge I faced was having to quickly learn and work with new technologies, which meant balancing learning the tools with actually applying them to the project. Another challenge was dividing the workload among team members and making sure everyone stayed on track so that all parts of the project were completed on time.

Jean-Luc Martel:

Elijah Hart: For me the biggest challenge was definitely integration, as I had issues testing on android initially and ran into some errors when trying to merge with other branches.

Andrew Arreola: A major challenge was making sure everyones work was able to merge together without any problems. We also had to handle version mismatches which lead to the application not functioning on some group members devices.

### Why was it a challenge?

Jose Valdez-Fernandez: This was a challenge because learning new technologies on my own was difficult, especially without constant guidance or prior experience to rely on. Additionally, working in a team required making sure everyone understood their responsibilities and staying organized so that all tasks were completed on time.

Jean-Luc Martel:

Elijah Hart: I ended up spending much more time than I initially anticipated when trying to make my pull requests, as I had to work through many errors in order to get my builds working.

Andrew Arreola: This was a major challenge because even if everyone's work was functioning on their own, it was still difficult to get an idea of what the final project would look like once everyones work was put together. 

### How was the challenge addressed? 

Jose Valdez-Fernandez: I handled the challenge by taking extra time to learn the tools through tutorials and practice. As a team, we stayed organized by dividing tasks clearly and checking in often to keep everything on track.

Jean-Luc Martel:

Elijah Hart: I made sure to account for the extra time it would take to integrate my work with the rest of the project.

Andrew Arreola: We handled this challenge by discussing what was conflicting whenever meeting in person and resolving those conflicts. 

### Favorite / most interesting part of this project

Jose Valdez-Fernandez: My favorite part was successfully connecting the API to the app and seeing all the team and player information displayed on the screen, which made the project feel complete and rewarding.

Jean-Luc Martel:

Elijah Hart: My favorite part was definitely getting to see the new pages I added after I got them working. It was very satisfying to see it after the long hours spent debugging.

Andrew Arreola: My favorite part was getting to learn react native. It was interesting to me because it is a technology that I have been wanting to learn. It was nice getting to use this new technology for an actual project.

### If you could do it over, what would you change?

Jose Valdez-Fernandez: I would make sure there was clearer communication within the team by setting clear responsibilities for who is doing what and establishing deadlines for when each task should be completed.

Jean-Luc Martel:

Elijah Hart: I would definitely be more proactive in resolving issues with my dev environment and try to avoid complex schemas for future databases.

Andrew Arreola:

### What is the most valuable thing you learned?

Jose Valdez-Fernandez: The most valuable thing I learned was experiencing what itâ€™s like to work on a real-world style project, where collaboration within a team is crucial to creating something meaningful.

Jean-Luc Martel:

Elijah Hart: The most valuable thing I learned was good time management, as I found that it was crucial for meeting our goals.

Andrew Arreola: The most valuable thing that I learned was the importance of communicating what everyone's task is. Without communication it can lead to conflicts/ disagreement on what the final project should look like. 

## Conclusion

### How successful was the project?
We would say the project was quite successful, as we were able to complete the features we set out to build. Overall, we are satisfied with both the functionality and the design of the app.

### What was the largest victory?

The largest victory was creating a fully running app that allows users to actively rank their favorite players and teams from any sport.

### Final assessment of the project

We all felt that this project was challenging and stressful at times, but in the end the experience was very rewarding. It gave us a glimpse into what a real software engineering project might look like and prepared us for the kinds of work we may encounter in our future careers.
